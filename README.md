# Snowflakes

Snowflakes is a [PHP](https://php.net/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package that provides:
 * A simple 128-bit id generator.
 * Methods to convert snowflakes ID into string

Snowflakes produces 128-bit and time-ordered ids. They run one on each node in infrastructure and will generate conflict-free ids on-demand without coordination.

The project is inspired by [Twitter's Snowflake](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake) and [Go implementation of Discord](https://github.com/bwmarrin/snowflake) but extended to 128-bit and not compatible with Twitter's Snowflake. This library provides a basis for id generation but not a service for handing out ids nor node id coordination.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```sh
composer require progamesigner/snowflakes
```

### Usage

```php
use ProGameSigner\Snowflakes\Node;

$node = new Node($worker_id);

$some_id = $node->next()->toString();
```

If you are using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), you can use `SnowflakesServiceProvider` shipped with this package. Configure `worker id` with `config('services.snowflakes.id', $worker_id)` and get snowflake with `resolve('snowflakes')->next()`.

### Format

Snowflakes ids are 128-bits wide described here from most significant to least significant bits:
* timestamp (64-bit) - milliseconds since the epoch (Jan 1 1970)
* node id(48-bit) - a configurable node id
* sequence (16-bit) - usually 0, increasing when more than one request in the same millisecond and reset to 0 when clock ticks forward

#### System Clock Dependency

You should use NTP to keep your system clock accurate. Snowflakes holds requests when non-monotonic clock detected. To run in a mode where NTP not move the clock backwards, see http://wiki.dovecot.org/TimeMovedBackwards#Time_synchronization for tips on how to do this.
